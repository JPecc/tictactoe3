How to Play Normal Tic-Tac-Toe:

Objective: The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Setup:

    The game is played on a 3x3 grid with 9 empty spaces.
    Player 1 uses the "X" mark, and Player 2 uses the "O" mark.

Rules:

    Players take turns placing their mark ("X" or "O") in an empty cell on the grid, which is numbered from 1 to 9.
        Cell positions are:

        1 | 2 | 3
        ---------
        4 | 5 | 6
        ---------
        7 | 8 | 9

    The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
    If all 9 cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
    Players alternate their turns until one of them wins or the game ends in a tie.

Ending the Game:

    If a player wins, the game ends immediately, and the winner is announced.
    If all spaces are filled and no one has won, the game is a tie.
    press 'n' to end the game.

How to Reset:

    Once the game ends, you can start a new game by resetting the board by pressing 'y', and players can take turns to play again.
